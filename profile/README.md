1. **Generation**: Create diagrams, describe the generation of DSL in natural language (through repeated communication), and generate diagrams based on "diagram as code".
2. **Conversion**: Transform manually drawn diagrams or diagrams drawn with the likes of Visio, into maintainable, assessable, improvable diagrams (diagram as code). The aim here isn't just to obtain a nice-looking diagram, but to prepare for what comes next.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the diagram/DSL from various angles - current considerations include title, labelling, abstraction level and granularity (consistency), and structure (reasonableness, completeness).
4. **Improvement**: Based on our experience (given to LLM), suggest improvements to the diagram (DSL).
5. **Coding**: Write or modify code based on the DSL (this step is not planned for the immediate future).
